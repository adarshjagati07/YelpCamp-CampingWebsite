# YelpCamp-CampingWebsite
This is a camping website, I have used MERN(mongodb express and nodejs) Stack to build this. This is a full stack application where you can add, edit, delete and search for your camp-grounds. I have also added Map functionality over here.

## Preview.
![Camping Website](https://github.com/adarshjagati07/YelpCamp-CampingWebsite-/assets/91245532/a68c5db0-834b-4ecb-8b0d-003e3f2f95fb)



## What you'll get
- You can register your campgrounds over here with charges and their images.
- You can add, remote or update your campgrounds.
- List the user with its details.
- Complete authentication is provided here with session tracking.
- You can view and select your campgrounds.
- Only the authenticated user is able to add the campground.
- I have provided map functionality over here, through which you can easily identify the place wherever you want to place your campground.

## Technologies used

- I am using HTML5, CSS3, vanilla javascript and BootStrap library for frontend related stuff.
- For backend I am using NodeJs, Express for server related work and MongoDB for database.

## You can run it locally.
- Install [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/).
-  Create a cloudinary account to get an API key and secret code.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/adarshjagati07/YelpCamp-CampingWebsite.git
cd YelpCamp-CampingWebsite
npm install
```

Create a .env file (your private information over here) in the root of the project with the following details:  

```
DATABASEURL='<url>'
API_KEY=''<key>
API_SECRET='<secret>'
```

Run ```mongod``` in another terminal and ```node app.js``` in the terminal with the project.  

Then in your browser go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).
(For any other references and error checking at your end, open your developer tools on the other side of browser.)
